# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Our team will meet every Tuesday from 8pm-9pm for progress check-ins. We will meet on Zoom and take turns taking meeting notes.


2. **Assistance** 
We have all added ourselves to a group message chat, and we have each others' phone numbers stored. In the case we need to ask for help or an opinion, we will message the group chat. We expect to see a response as soon as possible. We understand that we're all busy students, so by the latest there should be a response by the end of the day.


3. **Respect** 
At the beginning and end of each meeting, we will give an opportunity for everyone to speak about their current progress or concerns. In the middle of our meeting, we will fully engage with each others' conversations and talking points.


## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
We will split the workload by the different algorithms we are implementing. Two people will work on the complex algorithm, while one person each works on the BFS/DFS algorithm and covered algorithm. For major complications or unforeseen work, we will reach out to other members for advice or help. For example, for the complex algorithm, the two project members working on it can reach out to the rest of the group if the algorithm is difficult to understand, and then as a group we can figure out how to implement the algorithm if needed.

5. **Time Commitment** 
A total of three to five hours of work per week is expected of each group member. We may have to be wary for exams, RSOs, and job commitments, but we have made sure that all of us are able to make the Tuesday meeting. If a conflict or commitment occurs, we will message the group and make arrangements/ redistribute the work so that progress can still be made before the Tuesday meeting.


6. **Conflict Resolution** 
If there is a disagreement between members, we will politely discuss the issue and try to come to some compromise. If there's a situation where one or more members have not accomplished their task, we will have a discussion with the member to evaluate the situation. If work needs to be redivided/ members reassigned to an algorithm, we will then do so. If a member is habitually late, we will try to reschedule the Tuesday meeting time to a more convenient time for that group member. As we are all decent at keeping on top of work, we don't think there would be many concerns to discuss ahead of time. However, if a team member's behavior becomes detrimental to the group, then we will inform course staff after attempting our own actions to resolve the situation in a respectful manner.
